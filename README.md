## Current Tasks for Coding

Ariel's Quest
- figure out to properly have branches and pull requests on github

Pathing
- e.g, The only way to get to the church's basement is thru the church
- find out some way to do the pathing (list in lists? mapping it somehow?)
- mapping out the connections between locations
> seperate and doesn't interfere with other aspects (the look command searchs in the place json file based on name, as long as there are no repeating place names it'll work)

Shop - DONE
- Have a independent shop inventory json file (maybe have it seperate from the place json files?)
- buy items from the shop (if you have enough money)
- subtract money and add items to inventory, (subtract items from shop?)
> interacts with the inventory


Dialogue
- spit out set dialogue from the txt or json or whatever file for each character
- have the set dialogue for the main protagonist to respond with (3 options to choose from with 1, 2, 3)
- as for the rest idk, try to figure it out
- maybe some way to map out the dialogue (e.g, if you come back to the priest twice it's different dialogue)
> prob need to wait for the story to get more clear

Fighting - Optional (do it if you like to or have extra time ig)
- free reins
- maybe something like kingdom of loathing style?
- we might not have any fighting at all
- would there be things to equip? what stats to consider?
